c_tutorials
===========

Nothing too spectecular. Just some easy tutorials written in C.
All tutorials are free to use if you think they are helpful. Fork them, copy them, do what ever you want.
But if something breaks on your side, it's not my fault ;) I expect you know what you are doing.

Most of the projects are eclipse projects and do contain some compiled executables in the respective project folder.
All Projects have been developed and tested on OS X.

Do not expect high activity just yet.
And also feel free to ask me anything.


Happy coding! :)
